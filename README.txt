This is our final project for EE334 Embedded Systems Design.
The purpose of this project was to practice implementing features of a microcontroller by having them
interact with code in the format of a game.

The project was to implement a basic game using a MSP 432 microcontroller and boosterpack.
The game that the group implemented was a simple version of an asteroid shooter. The joystick
is used to move the cursor around the screen, and the top button can be used to shoot asteroids, 
which move randomly around the screen. After a timer finishes counting down, an end screen will 
appear, showing the total number of asteroids destroyed.
